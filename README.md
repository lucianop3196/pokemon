## Description

Single page application (SPA) to prove the use of differents technologies.
In this app, pokemons are shown with some of their characteristics.
The SPA consumes data from an extern API [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) through a backend developed in NodeJs using Express, adding new features to the original api

Moreover, pokemons could be created, with any specification wanted, and stored in database.

Features:

- Search pokemon
- Create a personalized pokemon
- Filter pokemons by source (API or database)
- Filter by type of pokemon
- Sort pokemons by strength
- Sort pokemons alphabetically
- Show details of each pokemon
- Refresh the pokemon's list
- Navigate through different pages
- Delete pokemons from database

## Pre - requirements

It is necessary to have at least the latest stable version of Node and NPM. Make sure you have it to be able to correctly install the necessary dependencies to run the project.

Required versions are:

- **Node**: 12.18.3 or greater
- **NPM**: 6.14.16 or greater

To check which version you have installed:

> node -v
>
> npm -v

## Instructions to start the development server

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a database in postgres called pokemon
3. There are two folders: api and client. In these folders will be the back-end and front-end code respectively.
4. Create a file in api called .env that has the following structure:

```
DB_USER=postgresUser
DB_PASSWORD=postgresPassword
DB_HOST=localhost
```

Replace userPostgres and postgresPassword with your own credentials to connect to postgres.

5. Run the following commands on the /api and /client folders

```
npm install

npm start
```

6. Finally open http://localhost:3000
